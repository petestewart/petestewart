### About Me

Hi I'm Pete, a software developer. I'm a 20-year veteran of the music industry, where I was fortunate to earn multiple Grammys as a producer, songwriter and recording engineer. As I watched that industry grow increasingly unstable in recent years, I knew it was time for a change in career paths. 

This is how I discovered software development—my next chapter in life.

Dev work has been a natural fit for me. It uses many of the creative and problem-solving skills that I developed by engineering and producing audio and music for so many years. And I love the satisfaction I feel in planning and building things with code. Currently I'm enrolled in the Full Stack Web Developer program at Nashville Software School and plan to graduate in late 2020.
